To-do List:
- clean() function has to be modified so that it keeps track of the columns. One way to do this is to assign v1,...,v1934 for each column, and ci as the new column appended to the matrix when i is integer column with NA's
- clean both test and train data and only do analysis on the columns that appeared both in clean_test and clean_train
- Build model and calculate the probability manually (Half done: Can't if model works since dimension does not match up, need to calculate probability)

Update:
- ???
