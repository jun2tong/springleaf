Summary of clean.data:
-> Dimension is 145231 x 2383
-> Still several columns containing only 0's
-> First column is still the index/ id of the row
-> Last column is still the class
-> Last column is changed to numeric

To-do List:
-> Change last column into categorical (i.e. factor in R)
-> Change the category of last column into {+1,-1} instead of {0,1}
-> Remove column names, annoying
-> Remove columns with only 0's
-> Partition data set into 6 sets, need to be tracked with its id
